                <h4>July 23, 2015</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>FansUnite</strong> was started by three sports fans in Canada, and intends to be a site for fellow fans offering transparency, fun, and top wagering advice via its social betting platform and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FansUnite  utilises virtual currency meaning, should they opt to, users are able to bet on sports without the risk of losing any actual money. A place for gamblers of all types to hone their skills, and interact.Team SBC caught up with <strong>CEO, Darius Eghdami</strong> to talk about all things FansUnite, as well as social betting and Bitcoin.

                        SBC: Darius, could you please describe to our readers what it is FansUnite offers, and how it differs to other betting operators?

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Darius:</strong> FansUnite gives users the opportunity to practice and bet on sports without the monetary risk.  Our community is comprised of users that exchange ideas, discuss upcoming games and share betting strategies so that they can be confident with their picks.
                        <p>
                        We differentiate ourselves by giving users access to thousands of handicappers, with full transparency behind their betting history, for a fraction of the cost of what most individual handicappers charge. We also separate ourselves by providing our community with PickTracker, an analytics engine we developed that identifies strengths and weaknesses that help users critically examine their betting patterns, as well as their peers’.

                            SBC: The monthly Revenue Share scheme seems an attractive and innovative inclusion. Could you tell us a little more about this, and how it’s been going since its launch?
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Darius:</strong> The entire premise of our site is to beat the books together.  The idea behind the Revenue Share is to give back to our community. Since launch, the top users each month have been unbelievable in sharing and contributing their thoughts and bets, so giving them a percentage of our subscription revenue is a great way to thank them.
                        <p>
                        Although the revenue share scheme is a new initiative, we’ve set up the structure to give each of our top 5 handicappers, 5% of our monthly subscription revenue. As our community continues to grow, we hope this will be a sizeable pot for each handicapper where they could potentially make a living off FansUnite.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Darius:</strong> FansUnite is a Canadian based company, so a lot of our users place bets on the major North American sports. NFL betting is massive as well as college basketball, come March. While football (soccer) is the most widely bet sport on our platform, we have a great community focused on Tennis, Rugby, Aussie Rules and more.
                        <p>
                            The fastest growing sport is eSports, as we’ve seen a massive emergence in this market over the last 12 months. This is a space we definitely want to increase our presence in, and it’s been remarkable to see the recent growth in not just bettors, but viewers and players as well.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Darius:</strong> CappersDelight was an amazing experience as it really highlighted the areas of the betting industry that we wanted to change. We ran CappersDelight for a couple years where we were just another handicapping service, hiding our full record and charging high subscription fees while our members had to ride the ups and downs of an individual handicapper. Coupled with the ongoing issues of transparency and verifiability, it confirmed to us that the traditional handicapping market was in need of massive changes.
                        <p>
                            We ran with the idea of FansUnite as we wanted to try and bring the suspect betting services out of the shadows by ensuring that the records of all members on our platform are transparent, available, and verifiable. As avid sports fans and bettors, we couldn’t think of anything cooler than building a platform that increased the profitability for sports bettors.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Darius:</strong> The Bitcoin industry is a very interesting one, as the older community doesn’t really understand what Bitcoin is, and the younger guys are starting to become wary of it. That being said, the thought of a reliable crypto-currency that allows an individual to remain anonymous can be very advantageous.
                        <p>
                            The team are big supporters of Bitcoin and would love to see it become a mainstay in the betting industry. We’ve been fortunate enough to team up with Nitrogen Sports in the running of our streak contests, which has been great. Unfortunately, I do not see Bitcoin becoming an accepted currency for the major sportsbooks. I think the smaller players will pick up on Bitcoin as a way to access a new user base, but I think the major ‘books will continue to avoid it as there are just too many uncertainties that accompany it. Although there are always fluctuations in currency value, Bitcoin is subject to extreme variances, which I think will continue to scare many sportsbooks.

                <h4>February 11, 2015</h4>
                <p>
                <strong>Vancouver, February 5, 2015:</strong> Darius Eghdami, CEO of FansUnite, has been bringing more transparency to the field of sports handicapping for the past 4 years. FansUnite continues to push out new features that enable users to  improve their returns by following top betting pro’s and analyzing their own betting patterns and results. FansUnite rolls out their much-anticipated PickTracker software today. This feature will enable users to analyze their betting history by allowing the user to view historical data and break down their past picks by sport, league, or bet-type and helping the user to look critically at their own betting patterns.
                </p>

                <div data-ng-show="press[1].show">
                    <p>
                    The idea behind FansUnite was originally conceptualized when Darius was a casual sports handicapper. He realized that in an industry where sports betting enthusiasts were often willing to invest in costly monthly subscriptions to follow a handicapper’s picks, it was relatively easy for these “professionals” to hide their comprehensive records because they would only selectively show their winning results to reflect their success. This slanted portrayal of “success” obviously put potential subscribers at a huge disadvantage when choosing whom to follow, as there is little transparency and resulted as the impetus behind FansUnite.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike traditional handicapping sites that offer insight into the general consensus of picks, the FansUnite platform is based on the notion that bettors no longer need to blindly follow “pros” because they can further research the historical data of the handicappers they follow in order to gain greater access and insight based on real analytics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FansUnite continues to evolve and produce more tools to improve the handicapping model to provide their user base more and more information. Every pick on the site goes through their proprietary algorithm to determine whether the pick is a “Pro Pick” based on factors such as the success and history on that sport and the teams involved. The FansUnite platform is attracting “pros” and their top handicappers are proving to be 10% more successful than the industry average. As an example, if you had bet $100 on every FansUnite NBA Pro Pick in January 2015, the profit would have been over $19,000.

                        Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, FansUnite specializes in crowd sourcing of handicappers’ picks to earn you more money. With a social aspect behind making your picks, the tight-knit FansUnite community is in it to “beat the books” together.

                    Darius is a Chartered Accountant and paused his career to pursue a passion in the sports handicapping world. As an avid sports bettor, he wanted to build a platform to level the playing field and bring some transparency to the industry.

                    <p>
                        Is everyone getting involved in betting and fantasy? It sure seems like it. Just this past weekend, according to an estimate done by the American Gaming Association, Americans were expected to wager $3.8 billion worth of illegal bets on the 2015 Super Bowl alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Comparing these figures to an estimated $1 billion being wagered on the English Premier League each week, and Interpol estimating that the unregulated Asian betting market is worth over $500 billion alone per year, the betting industry is continuing to sky rocket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Premier League, four of the 20 teams are sponsored directly by sports books:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aston Villa – 2 year contract with Dafabet for $16.5 million;</li>
                        <li>Burnley – 2 year contract with Fun 88 (Asian gambling house) for $3.3 million;</li>
                        <li>Hull City – 1 year contract with 12 Bet for $2.6 million;</li>
                        <li>Stoke City – will receive $5.5 million from Bet 365.</li>
                        <li>Crystal Palace will receive $1.5 million from Neteller, an online gambling payment processor.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With the recent noise coming from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, and Dallas Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban, along with our own research, we are confident that there is going to be a massive shift in the American sports betting market. Adam Silver stated that Congress should legalize sports betting and instituted a regulation scheme. Silver cited estimates that nearly $400 billion is illegally wagered on sports each year. We strongly believe FansUnite is perfectly situated to take advantage of this shift.

                <h4>January 16, 2014 - Malcolm Parry, Vancouver Sun</h4>
                <p>
                    BUSINESS LUNCH: At Homerand-Smithe's Homer Street Cafe Tuesday, Darius Eghdami relished the $20 daily roast and an $11 Zuccardi 'Q' Tempranillo 09 Mendoza. It's a safe bet he'll return to the Paris-like eatery. In fact, safe bets are his game, such as graduating as a chartered accountant to article at KPMG. Beyond that, he and like-aged Duncan McIntyre and Nicolas Shuster recently raised $250,000 to launch and develop a beta version of FansUnite.

                        "It's a virtual playground for sports bettors," said lifetime fan Eghdami, who, with the others, ran a handicapping system until 2011: "I charged $70 a week and sat at the back in class at UBC, making picks."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, he says paying one handicapper is a mug's game. That's because FansUnite's platform (fansunite.com) aims to include "10,000 handicappers who are making picks while we are tracking their records and verifying them ... so you can filter those who are best by week, month and all-time, by sports, by team and by betting type - outright win, spread, over-under." All for $15 a month, which FansUnite will charge after releasing fully this summer.

                        "Our motto is making betting social, Our goal is to make everybody win more money" said Eghdami, whose developer-father Kombiz's VLINX ecommerce trading platform "was a big help in setting up FansUnite."

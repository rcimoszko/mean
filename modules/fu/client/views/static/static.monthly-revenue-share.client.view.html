            It has always been our intention at FansUnite to take care of our community. As of now, we have given away cash and prizes through our NHL Playoff contest, NFL Playoff contest, NBA Playoff contest, March Madness ATS Bracket Challenge, and our World Cup Bracket Challenge. Now, we want to take things to the next level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now at FansUnite you will get paid if you are one of our top users!
        </p>

        <p>
            One of our aims is to add transparency to the sports betting world. So, what we are going to do is detail how much each user will receive.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every user who submits picks will be ranked on a calendar month leaderboard. The top 5 users, based on profit, will be paid out a portion of any Pro Membership revenue that FansUnite brings in that calendar month.
        <ol>
            <li>First Place - 5%</li>
            <li>Second Place - 5%</li>
            <li>Third Place - 5%</li>
            <li>Fourth Place - 5%</li>
            <li>Fifth Place - 5%</li>
        </ol>
        We will pay each eligible user, via paypal, at the end of that calendar month. As FansUnite grows, so will the payout to our top handicappers. The rest of our revenue will be used to take the platform to the levels that you deserve. FansUnite is going to be the world's top sports social community with all of the betting resources you need. This is the least we can do for the wonderful support you have provided us with.

    <accordion-group heading="Why can I only play a maximum of 5 units per game?">
      We believe that having a maximum of 5 units per game restricts a user from placing a large, unrealistic sum of units on any single game. By placing a restriction on the amount of units playable in a game, other users can realistically follow our users’ picks for real wagers. We stress for our users to wager the amount of units based on their confidence in their prediction.
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="How many units do I get per week? Is there anyway to get more?">
      Each user will receive 150 units per week to play with. Units will reset back to 150 each Monday at 1:00am PST. There is no way to receive more units as we are trying to keep a level playing field between users. Do not save units, as none will be carried over to the next week.
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="Why can I no longer see other users upcoming picks?">
      You may not be able to see other users’ upcoming picks for a couple of reasons. Firstly, make sure that you are signed into your FansUnite account. Secondly, the pick may be classified as a pro pick. Sign up as a pro member to view all user picks on the site.
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="What is the FansUnite Consensus?">
      The FansUnite consensus shows the percentage of units being placed on either side of a game by the FansUnite community.
    </accordion-group>
    <accordion-group heading="What is PickTracker?">
      PickTracker allows our users to analyze their picking history. PickTracker shows the user the bet type, sport, league, or favorite/underdog where they are making the most profit and areas they are struggling with and should stay away from. PickTracker is a great tool to take out the human emotion in handicapping.
